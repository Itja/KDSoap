Introduction
============
KD Soap is a Qt-based client-side and server-side SOAP component.

It can be used to create client applications for web services and also provides
the means to create web services without the need for any further component such
as a dedicated web server.

KDSoap also supports writing SOAP servers easily.

KD Soap targets C++ programmers who use Qt in their applications.
